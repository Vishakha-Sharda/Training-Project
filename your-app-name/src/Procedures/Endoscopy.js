//       <p>
//         Endoscopy is a medical procedure that allows doctors to examine and visualize the interior of
//         certain organs or areas of the body using an endoscope, a flexible tube with a light and camera.
//       </p>
//       <p><strong>What is an endoscopy?</strong></p>
//       <p>
//         An endoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure used for diagnostic and sometimes therapeutic purposes.
//         It provides real-time images of the inside of the body, helping doctors diagnose and treat various conditions.
//       </p>
//       <p><strong>Types of Endoscopy Procedures:</strong></p>
//       <ul>
//         <li>Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (GI Endoscopy) - Examines the digestive tract.</li>
//         <li>Colonoscopy - Views the large intestine (colon).</li>
//         <li>Bronchoscopy - Inspects the airways and lungs.</li>
//         <li>Cystoscopy - Examines the bladder and urinary tract.</li>
//         <li>Upper Endoscopy - Evaluates the esophagus, stomach, and upper small intestine.</li>
//         <li>Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) - Combines endoscopy with ultrasound for detailed imaging.</li>
//         <li>And more...</li>
//       </ul>
//       <p><strong>Why do I need an endoscopy?</strong></p>
//       <p>
//         Endoscopy can be recommended for various reasons, such as investigating unexplained symptoms, diagnosing
//         diseases or conditions, and guiding treatments like the removal of polyps, biopsies, or cancer staging.
//       </p>
//       <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
//       <p>
//         During an endoscopy, a specialized endoscope is inserted into the body through natural openings like the
//         mouth, anus, or through small incisions. The camera on the endoscope captures images displayed on a monitor,
//         allowing the doctor to examine the affected area.
//       </p>
//       <p><strong>Risks and complications:</strong></p>
//       <ul>
//         <li>Risks are generally low, but there may be rare complications like bleeding or infection.</li>
//         <li>Complications can vary depending on the type of endoscopy and the individual's health.</li>
//         <li>Your doctor will discuss potential risks and benefits before the procedure.</li>
//       </ul>
//       <p><strong>Recovery time:</strong></p>
//       <p>
//         Most endoscopy procedures are outpatient, and patients can often return to normal activities shortly after.
//         However, you may need some time to recover from the effects of sedation or anesthesia.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         If you're considering an endoscopy or have questions, it's essential to consult with a medical professional.

        <p>
          Endoscopy is a medical procedure that allows doctors to examine the
          inside of the body using an endoscopeâ€”a flexible tube with a light and
          camera attached to it. The endoscope is inserted through an orifice or
          small incision to provide visuals of organs such as the digestive
          tract, respiratory system, or urinary system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Endoscopy serves various diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and
          helps doctors identify and treat conditions like ulcers, polyps,
          tumors, and inflammation.

          The recovery time after an endoscopy varies depending on the specific

        <p>
          The cost of an endoscopy can vary based on factors like the type of
          procedure, location, and insurance coverage. It typically ranges from
          $800 to $2,500.

        <p>
          During your endoscopy appointment, your doctor will explain the
          procedure, its purpose, and what you can expect. You may be asked
          questions about your medical history, symptoms, and any allergies. The
          doctor will perform the endoscopy and provide you with details

        <p>
          It's often a good idea to bring a family member or friend who can

        <p>
          An endoscopy is typically not a routine checkup but is conducted when

          preparation for the procedure.

          Most people can return to work or school within a day or two after
