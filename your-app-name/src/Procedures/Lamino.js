              Laminectomy is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of
              the lamina, a part of the vertebral bone, to relieve pressure on
              the spinal cord or nerves within the spinal column.

        </p>
        <p>
          Laminectomy is a surgical procedure that addresses conditions like
          spinal stenosis and herniated discs by creating space within the
          spinal canal. This relieves pressure on the spinal cord and nerves,
          helping to reduce pain and improve mobility.
