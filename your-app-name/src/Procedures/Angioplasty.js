 <p>An angioplasty is a minimally invasive medical procedure used to open up narrowed or blocked sections of blood vessels </p>
 <p>An angioplasty, also known as a stenting procedure, is used to open up narrowed or blocked arteries
 in the body. The term comes from Greek words meaning “angle” and “plasty,” referring to the shape of the device that opens
 in the body and improve blood flow.</p>
 <br/>
 <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>Why do I need an angioplasty? </strong></p>
 <ul>
 <li>To treat coronary artery disease: This includes conditions such as heart attack, chest pain,
 unstable angina, and peripheral vascular disease.</li>
 <li>To treat carotid artery disease: This can cause symptoms like weakness in one arm, numbness,
 pins & needles, vision changes, dizziness, fainting spells, and even loss of hearing.</li>
 <li>To treat abnormalities in the bone that form when a blood vessel grows on top of another.</li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
 <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>How does it work? </strong></p>
 <ol>
    <li>A doctor will first make an X-ray picture of your heart and arteries to see what needs to be treated.</li>
    <li>A doctor will insert a small catheter through a vein in your leg into the affected artery.</li>
    <li>Once inside the artery, the catheter will be guided to where there are blockages or narrows.</li>
    <li>The catheter will then inflate with air to make a balloon-like device called a stent which helps keep
    the artery open.</li>
    <li>After the ballooning process, the catheter is removed and the patient leaves the hospital within few days.</li>
    <li>If necessary, additional stents may be placed at different points along the length of the
    blockage.</li>
    <li>After the procedure, you will go home and recover in the hospital for about two weeks.</li>
    </ol>
    <br/>
    <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>Risks and complications include: </strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Bleeding during or after the procedure</li>
    <li>Infection</li>
    <li>Embolization (a clot forms in the graft)</li>
    <li>Stroke or TIA (transient ischemic attack)</li>
    <li>Thromboembolism (blood clots traveling elsewhere in the body)</li>
    <li>Allergic reactions to contrast material</li>
    <li>Perforation of the graft</li>
    <li>Graft failure</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>Recovery time: </strong></p>
    <p>You should avoid heavy lifting, strenuous exercise, or bending for several days after having
    angioplasty. You will have swelling in the legs, arms, hands, face, jaw, neck, and head. P
    eople usually spend a few nights sleeping sitting up before they start driving or doing other
    activities again. The swelling goes away within 24 hours. If you experience any severe symptoms,
    contact your doctor immediately.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>Cost: </strong></p>
    <p>Angioplasty costs vary depending on factors such as location, insurance coverage, and
    the number of procedures performed. Typically, the cost ranges from $10,000 to $35,000 per
    procedure.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>Alternative treatment options: </strong></p>
    <p>There are alternative treatment options available if you're not good candidates for
    angioplasty. These might include medications to manage your condition, lifestyle changes, or
    surgery.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>What else can I expect during my appointment? </strong></p>
    <p>During your appointment, you can expect to answer questions about your medical history,
    current health status, and any concerns you have about your heart conditions. Your doctor
    will also perform an examination including listening to your heart sounds using a stethoscope
    and taking your pulse. They may take a complete blood count (CBC), electrocardiogram (ECG),
    chest X-ray, stress test, and possibly ultrasound imaging. Angioplasty itself takes about one hour
    but recovery can last longer than that.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>Can I bring someone with me for support? </strong></p>
    <p>Yes, it’s recommended to bring a friend or family member who can provide emotional support
    during the procedure. However, please ask permission first because some facilities may require
    advance notice due to security reasons.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>Is this a routine checkup? </strong></p>
    <p>No, angioplasty is typically considered elective care meaning it isn’t part of regular
    preventative health checks. It’s often scheduled when there are specific symptoms or risk
    factors identified by your doctor.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>Do I need to make any dietary restrictions? </strong></p>
    <p>Your doctor may recommend certain diets or supplements while you recover from
    angioplasty. Always discuss these requirements with them ahead of time so you can plan accordingly.
    For example, you may be asked to eat soft foods, avoid alcohol, and stay hydrated.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>How long do I need to wait before returning to work/school? </strong></p>
    <p>Most people return to their normal activities within two weeks after angioplasty. but
    this depends on how quickly your swelling improves and whether you have any complications.
    Follow your doctor’s instructions carefully.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>Will I need follow-up appointments? </strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you will likely need follow-up appointments to monitor the results of your angioplasty.
    This includes checking on how well the procedure has worked and making sure you don’t develop
    another blockage.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><strong style={{ fontSize: '20px'}}>Are there risks associated with angioplasty? </strong></p>
    <p>As with all medical treatments, there are potential risks and side effects. Some
    common ones include bleeding, infection, stroke, heart attack, and death. But overall,
    angioplasty is safe when done properly under experienced care.</p>
